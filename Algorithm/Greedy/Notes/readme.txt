üß© Step 4: Flow of Any Greedy Algorithm

Almost every greedy algorithm follows this structure:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Sort data based on some logic
2Ô∏è‚É£ Iterate through sorted elements
3Ô∏è‚É£ Choose the best possible option at each step
4Ô∏è‚É£ Stop when you reach a limit (capacity, time, etc.)


üßÆ Step 5: Practice Progression (in Smart Order)

You‚Äôve done:
‚úÖ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fractional Knapsack

| #   | Problem                    | Concept Focus                             | Example                                |
| --- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **Job Sequencing Problem** | Profit maximization by sorting deadlines  | Schedule jobs for max profit           |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **Activity Selection**     | Interval scheduling (end times sorting)   | Choose max activities without overlap  |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Huffman Encoding**       | Minimum cost to encode data               | Priority-based merging (greedy + heap) |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | **Minimum Coins**          | Change-making problem                     | Fewest coins for target value          |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | **Egyptian Fraction**      | Convert fraction to sum of unit fractions | Mathematical greedy                    |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£ | **Optimal Merge Pattern**  | Combine files with min cost               | Greedy merging (like Huffman)          |


These 7 are the core greedy problems you must master.
No graph knowledge needed for the first 5.
