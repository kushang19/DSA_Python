🧮 A. Simple (Basic) Sorting Algorithms

These are easy to understand and implement — perfect to start with:

Algorithm	Technique	Time Complexity (Average)	Stable?	Best for learning recursion?
Bubble Sort	Compare adjacent elements & swap	O(n²)	✅	❌ (iterative)
Selection Sort	Pick the smallest each pass	O(n²)	❌	❌
Insertion Sort	Build sorted part one by one	O(n²)	✅	❌
Recursive Insertion Sort	Same as above, but recursive	O(n²)	✅	✅


⚙️ B. Divide & Conquer Sorting Algorithms

These use recursion heavily — perfect next step after your recursion practice.

Algorithm	Idea	Time Complexity	Stable?
Merge Sort	Divide array in halves, sort each, merge	O(n log n)	✅
Quick Sort	Pick a pivot, partition, recursively sort	O(n log n)	❌ (usually)
Heap Sort	Use heap data structure	O(n log n)	❌


💨 C. Advanced / Non-Comparison Based

These are used for special types of input (like integers or strings).

Algorithm	Idea	Time Complexity	Stable?
Counting Sort	Count frequencies of numbers	O(n + k)	✅
Radix Sort	Sort digits from LSD to MSD	O(nk)	✅
Bucket Sort	Distribute into buckets, sort inside	O(n + k)	✅
🧠 3️⃣ The Ideal Learning Path (Recommended for You)

Since you already know recursion, here’s the perfect roadmap 👇

Step	Algorithm	Why
1	Bubble Sort	Easiest to visualize swaps
2	Selection Sort	Understand how min/max selection works
3	Insertion Sort	Helps understand “building sorted array”
4	Merge Sort (Recursive)	First real recursive sorting algorithm
5	Quick Sort (Recursive)	Reinforces recursion + partitioning logic
6	Heap Sort	Bridges sorting + tree data structure
7	Counting / Radix Sort	Introduces non-comparison sorting

| Algorithm     | Core Idea                 | What moves?            | Stable? | Key Step                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Bubble**    | Compare adjacents         | Largest bubbles to end | ✅       | Swap if `arr[j] > arr[j+1]`     |
| **Selection** | Find minimum each pass    | Minimum fixed at front | ❌       | Find index of min → swap        |
| **Insertion** | Insert into sorted prefix | Key slides left        | ✅       | Shift elements > key rightwards |



| Algorithm          | Best  | Average | Worst | Space | Stable |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| **Bubble Sort**    | O(n)  | O(n²)   | O(n²) | O(1)  | ✅      |
| **Selection Sort** | O(n²) | O(n²)   | O(n²) | O(1)  | ❌      |
| **Insertion Sort** | O(n)  | O(n²)   | O(n²) | O(1)  | ✅      |


| If you remember this…                            | You’ll never mix them up   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 🫧 **Bubble** → bubbles rise → largest goes last | Bubble = swap adjacents    |
| 🧲 **Selection** → “select the smallest”         | Select = find min and swap |
| 🃏 **Insertion** → like sorting cards            | Insert = shift & place key |
