Heap = Data Structure to manage information

Heap is called as 
-binary heap or 
-nearly completed binary tree (levels filled except the lowest, lowest level filled to a certain point starting from the left) i.e ACBT - Almost Complete Binary Tree 

Uses:
- heapsort 
- priority queues

Type:
- max-heap (value of node i<= parent) , use for heapsort
- min-heap (value of node i>= parent) , use for priority queues 

- height of heap is O(log n)

- Note: put root of heap in index 1 instead of 0 as it keeps arithmetic cleaner


Topics to learn :
1. Insertion 
2. Deletion 
3. Heap Sort
4. Heapify
5. Array Representation 
6. Priority Queue


Indexes follow starting from 0: 

Left child of index i: 2*i + 1

Right child of index i: 2*i + 2

Parent of index i: (i-1)//2

Last non-leaf node:  (n // 2) - 1 = 4
