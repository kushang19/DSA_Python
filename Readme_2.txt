Graphs
    BFS, DFS
    Topological Sort
    Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
    Shortest Path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
    Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal, Prim)

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Algorithmic Paradigms (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeKig3OLsM8&list=PLLOxZwkBK52AvXNogQoZ5o35GNlygw_YD&index=1)

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Advanced Topics

Bit Manipulation
Math for DSA (GCD, modular arithmetic, combinatorics basics)

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: CS Fundamentals (for interviews beyond coding rounds)
Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Operating System basics (process vs thread, deadlocks, scheduling)
Databases (SQL & NoSQL basics)
Computer Networks basics (TCP vs UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, OSI model)

ðŸ”¹ Step 7: System Design (for senior/onsite rounds)

Low-level design (OOD, design patterns)
High-level design (Scalability, Load balancing, Caching, Sharding, CAP theorem)



âœ… This is the right flow:

Start with complexity & recursion â†’

then linear data structures â†’

then non-linear structures (trees, graphs, heaps) â†’

then algorithms (sorting, DP, greedy, divide-conquer) â†’

finally advanced topics + CS fundamentals + system design.

ðŸ“Œ So the ideal flow after Deque is:

Recursion & Backtracking

Hashing (Hash tables, maps, sets, collision handling basics)

Binary Trees (BT) â†’ Preorder, Inorder, Postorder traversal

Binary Search Trees (BST) â†’ Insert, delete, search

Heaps & Priority Queue

Min Heap / Max Heap

Heapify, Heap Sort

Implementing Priority Queue using Heap
